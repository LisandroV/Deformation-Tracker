# Deformation-Tracker
In this repo I'll explore diverse neural network architectures to predict the deformation of objects

Explanation of data:
There are three types of files.
1. Force file.This file has the following content:

To fix the code format according to the PEP8 standard:
```
black .
```

## Visualize training loss
Tensorboard is used to visualize the training loss.

Run this command to run tensorboard:
```
tensorboard --logdir=./logs --port=6006
```
